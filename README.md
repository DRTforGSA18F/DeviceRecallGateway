##Overview
DRT embraced the spirit of the 18F challenge from the beginning.  We understand that for the government to bring efficient, user-centric digital services to the American people at scale, it must partner with industry.  And we understand that good partnership means both sides working for each other.  DRT was prepared to submit on the government’s original schedule, ultimately deciding to hold to that original 26 June deadline.  Our beta is presented at the link above, and is well on its way to being an MVP that enhances American’s interaction with the government’s available food safety data.  

##One Leader
Geoff Dick was our product owner, with ultimate accountability for delivery. Geoff has over 15 years of experience delivering user-centric digital products in the commercial and federal sectors.

##The Team
The DRT 18F ADS 1 development team has demonstrated experience bringing improved digital services to Americans.  We are compriseda of seasoned products managers, developers, and designers who both work and play in this space.
